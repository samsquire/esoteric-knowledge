Words and letters are meaningful.

Words are people.

# Ranking and ordering
![](bee.png)
 * The feet(s) of a word is on the left hand side and at the bottom of the letter.
 * Imagine that the letters and words are an army.
 * The head of a word is on its right and on its top.
 * Ranking and ordering is to flip the orientation of the letters so the words become a different person.
 * If I rank a sentence, the feet turn to the left
