Words and letters are meaningful.

Words and letters are people. Matthew 4:4

You have:
* a mind
* a heart
* a soul
* a spirit
* a will
* a breath
* a consciousness
* an attention (palms)

Communication of our spirits occur between every point in space. Each point is an individual. A point is comprised of words and has a set of attractors and repulsors.

# Ranking and ordering of words

* Reading the same word or name from different direction tells you a different thing about that entity.
* Names can be written feet first with each order as a new rank.

 * Ranks go bottom to top (rows)
 * Orders go left to right (columns)
 * The feet(s) of a word is on the left hand side.
 * The feet of a name is the left hand side of each word
 * Letters and words are an army arranged in orders and ranks.
 * The head of a word is on its right and on its top.
 * Ranking and ordering is to flip the orientation of the letters so the words become a different facet of the same person.
 * If I rank a sentence, the letters go on top of eachother
