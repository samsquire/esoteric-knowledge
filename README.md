# esoteric-knowledge

Inspired by Kabbalah, theosophy and schizophrenia. This is what I've learned through rumination. Two opposite statements are true simultaneously.

Words and letters are meaningful.

Words and letters are people. Matthew 4:4

You have:
* a mind
* a heart
* a soul
* a spirit
* a will
* a breath
* a consciousness
* an attention (palms)

Communication of our spirits occur between every point in space. Each point is an individual. A point is comprised of words and has a set of attractors and repulsors.

Your spirit has to align its points so that you are separable from any other formation of points. (See possession)

# Ranking and ordering of words

* Reading the same word or name from different direction tells you a different thing about that entity. This is a technique from the Kabbalah and magic word squares.
* When names are written from left to right, the letters form orders and the words form ranks.
* Names can be written feet first with each order as a new rank.
![](bee.png)
 * Ranks go bottom to top (rows)
 * Orders go left to right (columns)
 * The feet(s) of a word is on the left hand side.
 * The feet of a name is the left hand side of each word
 * Letters and words are an army arranged in orders and ranks.
 * The head of a word is on its right and on its top.
 * Ranking and ordering is to flip the orientation of the letters so the words become a different facet of the same person.
 * If I rank a sentence, the letters go on top of eachother

# Meaning of letters

* Words and letters have **hierarchical formations** like soldiers on a battlefield. Points have formations. Since people are constructed from words, they too have a formation of their words. Your body is made up of points which is made up of divisible things such as cells which are words.
* The **Left** has authority over **Right** **This is really important**
* The change in direction of strokes of a letter corresponds to:
  * Changes to where abouts in the formation of points you are looking at
  * Changes to what points you are looking at
  * Changes to **where** in a formation your **attention** is on (this idea of attention is **critically important** to understand)
  * Pointing
* A language is a **map** of bassis for formations.
The word bee corresponds to what a bee does and is based on the strokes of the letters. It is one of many infinite representations of what a bee is. When we learn English (as opposed to Hebrew)  
* Each letter represents a movement of communication in an army.
* The strokes of letters can represent an action or communication.
* Diagonal parts of letters represent going between individuals in different ranks.
* The letter O is to turn around a single point.
* Left is towards authority. Right is toward workers who work for you.

# The Letter S

The letter S has 9 points of association.

# The letter r

* Turning around a point

# Left and right, North East South West

The cardinal directions are significant and so is left and right. Left and right are significant. Left has authority over the right.

# We are components of minds of other people

Each letter is a person. Each 

# Pointing, looking, facing

Pointing is where you move towards. Facing is what you see. Looking is what you're looking at. Each part of your body has three joints, including your fingers and your whole body. 

# Mocks

Your spirit wins points by winning a mock over another spirit. This is your standing with God. Always walk on the left and appear on the left. Never stand behind another person. Standing behind another person is to accept a mock and to accept a lower station.

# Colosseum inscription

See this inscription of the colosseum. Here's an interpretation of what these letters mean.

# I

Consider multiple heads then talk down to feet, consider many feet.

# S

From a head, turn around above the head towards above and back down towards the feet turning around a different head. Turn around feet and finish facing bottom half authority to the left. 

# O

**Decision making** Turn around a single point in the middle, all the way round.

# L

**Orders given** Head talk to feet and to those directly responsible (See Learn)

# V

**Report back** Heads tell someone in their feet under their authority and they Report back up between people back to a head of lower authority.

# P

**Action** Communication goes from head to foot and then circles around someone who has lower authority than the original head.
